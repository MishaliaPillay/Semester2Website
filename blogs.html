              Blog Post 1 - Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              Data visualisation is used to depict data in a manner that makes
              it understandable and readable (Li, 2020, p. 17). There is an
              immeasurable quantity of both large and small-scale data (Li,
              2020, p. 17) (Sadiku et al., 2016). Data is described as
              unprocessed information. There is a need for this “raw unprocessed
              information” to be translated into a visualised form (Li, 2020, p.
              18). This is because data is often consulted in decision-making to
              provide insight into certain subject matter. This in turn
              expresses concern for the narrative conveyed by the visualisation.
              Which calls for careful consideration from the designer and the
              choices made when choosing forms of data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The concept of Semiology suggests that visual depictions are signs
              that construct meaning (Kidd, 2015, p.22). Data that is
              unprocessed and not represented lacks meaning and fails to convey
              information (Li, 2020, p. 17). Thus, data is only given meaning
              and a purpose when it is represented through data visualisation.
              This takes the raw unprocessed data and communicates it,
              recognisably and understandably (Li, 2020, p. 21). This meaningful
              information can then be utilised for various purposes across
              different fields (Li, 2020, p. 17). However, the designer is
              required to compare the advantages offered by each of the forms of
              data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Different datasets require different data visualisation forms
              since each has its connotations (Kidd, 2015, p.23). Which impacts
              what is signified for the receiver (Kidd, 2015, p.24). The visual
              displays of data make use of signs that at first glance gives the
              viewer some insight as to the meaning of the information
              displayed. An example of this is the “Trees” form of data
              visualisation which consists of root nodes (Li, 2020, p. 24). This
              form arranges data by exhibiting it as a “network of nodes” (Li,
              2020, p. 24). The advantage of this is that the Tree form can
              display a larger datset. The connotation of using this data set is
              that all the nodes are connected which relay the relationships
              between them. Another connotation is that all nodes can be traced
              back to a single node thus this data set contains information that
              cannot standalone and each nodes feed into the next. There is also
              a hierarchical structure. This presence of a hierarchy implies
              that there is no equal level of importance between the individual
              nodes. Thus, some parts may be glanced over while others require a
              closer look and more attention from the viewer (Li, 2020, p. 24).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Li, 2020 discusses the uses and some advantages of the forms of
              data visualization. Despite the many advantages of a form, it may
              not be considered a method of displaying some datasets based on
              the intended meaning of that set. This can be seen by the
              comparison of the “Table” and “Graphs” forms (Figures 1 and 2).
              Tables offer the affordance of accuracy depiction since it shows
              the precise value without an illustration (Li, 2020, p. 30).
              Graphs however offer an illustration without exact values (Li,
              2020, p. 37). The advantage of using a graph is the insight that
              it offers the reader, they can see an overall trend but cannot
              directly identify the exact differences between the data. Tables
              offer further insight since actual values are on display (Li,
              2020, p. 30). Both forms show data and relay information to the
              reader. The defining factor when choosing these two forms is what
              data is being represented and what fits the needs of the ideal
              reader.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              “The presentation of information in data form can have its own
              weight” and this statement stresses the impact that visualisation
              has on the viewer (Kidd, 2015, p.32). If there is a disconnect
              between the observed and the understood, then the visualisation
              becomes an example of misinformation (Kidd, 2015, p.23). This is
              an issue since the visualisation is intended to translate the data
              into something meaningful. There are a multitude of meanings that
              can be constructed by a visualisation (Kidd, 2015, p.26). This
              depends on the intention of the designer which for example could
              be to inform or to mislead (Li, 2020). However, a designer may
              have one intention, but the resulting visualisation is not in line
              with this. Which displays the value of being educated on data
              visualisations and representation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              According to Representation and Myth, the signifier is layered and
              takes place at both a connotative and denotative level (Kidd,
              2015, p.23). Thus, is essential to consider the context
              surrounding the representation and its presentation. let us take a
              closer look at an example from earlier with “Graphs” and “Tables.”
              Since a table requires reading and graphs are interacted with
              visually, one needs to consider the context before deciding on the
              data visualisation form (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). If the form is used
              in a live presentation, then a Graph is favoured since the
              audience can get a quick insight into the matter discussed
              (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). However, if the Form is used in scientific
              research, then specific values are needed, and a Table shows this.
              The connotational impact is seen by the way a representation
              “frames and feeds” the understanding of a form. An example is a
              bar graph that does not start at zero on an axis which is more
              than likely to frame a situation differently by skewing one&apos;s
              perspective (Figure 3). It may zoom into slight differences making
              it seem greater than it is (Knaflic, 2015, p.43)
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The digital era has increased the rate of data collection and
              distribution. This increases the demand for Data visualisation
              (Sadiku et al., 2016). This is where we need to look at what and
              how information is being represented, as well as whose values are
              being shared through the representation. Designer is encouraged to
              educate themselves on the impact of their work and how to
              effectively communicate it to an audience. This is done by
              utilising the various advantages of the different data
              visualization forms.
