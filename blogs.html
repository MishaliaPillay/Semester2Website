              Blog Post 1 - Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              Data visualisation is used to depict data in a manner that makes
              it understandable and readable (Li, 2020, p. 17). There is an
              immeasurable quantity of both large and small-scale data (Li,
              2020, p. 17) (Sadiku et al., 2016). Data is described as
              unprocessed information. There is a need for this “raw unprocessed
              information” to be translated into a visualised form (Li, 2020, p.
              18). This is because data is often consulted in decision-making to
              provide insight into certain subject matter. This in turn
              expresses concern for the narrative conveyed by the visualisation.
              Which calls for careful consideration from the designer and the
              choices made when choosing forms of data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The concept of Semiology suggests that visual depictions are signs
              that construct meaning (Kidd, 2015, p.22). Data that is
              unprocessed and not represented lacks meaning and fails to convey
              information (Li, 2020, p. 17). Thus, data is only given meaning
              and a purpose when it is represented through data visualisation.
              This takes the raw unprocessed data and communicates it,
              recognisably and understandably (Li, 2020, p. 21). This meaningful
              information can then be utilised for various purposes across
              different fields (Li, 2020, p. 17). However, the designer is
              required to compare the advantages offered by each of the forms of
              data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Different datasets require different data visualisation forms
              since each has its connotations (Kidd, 2015, p.23). Which impacts
              what is signified for the receiver (Kidd, 2015, p.24). The visual
              displays of data make use of signs that at first glance gives the
              viewer some insight as to the meaning of the information
              displayed. An example of this is the “Trees” form of data
              visualisation which consists of root nodes (Li, 2020, p. 24). This
              form arranges data by exhibiting it as a “network of nodes” (Li,
              2020, p. 24). The advantage of this is that the Tree form can
              display a larger datset. The connotation of using this data set is
              that all the nodes are connected which relay the relationships
              between them. Another connotation is that all nodes can be traced
              back to a single node thus this data set contains information that
              cannot standalone and each nodes feed into the next. There is also
              a hierarchical structure. This presence of a hierarchy implies
              that there is no equal level of importance between the individual
              nodes. Thus, some parts may be glanced over while others require a
              closer look and more attention from the viewer (Li, 2020, p. 24).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Li, 2020 discusses the uses and some advantages of the forms of
              data visualization. Despite the many advantages of a form, it may
              not be considered a method of displaying some datasets based on
              the intended meaning of that set. This can be seen by the
              comparison of the “Table” and “Graphs” forms (Figures 1 and 2).
              Tables offer the affordance of accuracy depiction since it shows
              the precise value without an illustration (Li, 2020, p. 30).
              Graphs however offer an illustration without exact values (Li,
              2020, p. 37). The advantage of using a graph is the insight that
              it offers the reader, they can see an overall trend but cannot
              directly identify the exact differences between the data. Tables
              offer further insight since actual values are on display (Li,
              2020, p. 30). Both forms show data and relay information to the
              reader. The defining factor when choosing these two forms is what
              data is being represented and what fits the needs of the ideal
              reader.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              “The presentation of information in data form can have its own
              weight” and this statement stresses the impact that visualisation
              has on the viewer (Kidd, 2015, p.32). If there is a disconnect
              between the observed and the understood, then the visualisation
              becomes an example of misinformation (Kidd, 2015, p.23). This is
              an issue since the visualisation is intended to translate the data
              into something meaningful. There are a multitude of meanings that
              can be constructed by a visualisation (Kidd, 2015, p.26). This
              depends on the intention of the designer which for example could
              be to inform or to mislead (Li, 2020). However, a designer may
              have one intention, but the resulting visualisation is not in line
              with this. Which displays the value of being educated on data
              visualisations and representation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              According to Representation and Myth, the signifier is layered and
              takes place at both a connotative and denotative level (Kidd,
              2015, p.23). Thus, is essential to consider the context
              surrounding the representation and its presentation. let us take a
              closer look at an example from earlier with “Graphs” and “Tables.”
              Since a table requires reading and graphs are interacted with
              visually, one needs to consider the context before deciding on the
              data visualisation form (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). If the form is used
              in a live presentation, then a Graph is favoured since the
              audience can get a quick insight into the matter discussed
              (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). However, if the Form is used in scientific
              research, then specific values are needed, and a Table shows this.
              The connotational impact is seen by the way a representation
              “frames and feeds” the understanding of a form. An example is a
              bar graph that does not start at zero on an axis which is more
              than likely to frame a situation differently by skewing one&apos;s
              perspective (Figure 3). It may zoom into slight differences making
              it seem greater than it is (Knaflic, 2015, p.43)
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The digital era has increased the rate of data collection and
              distribution. This increases the demand for Data visualisation
              (Sadiku et al., 2016). This is where we need to look at what and
              how information is being represented, as well as whose values are
              being shared through the representation. Designer is encouraged to
              educate themselves on the impact of their work and how to
              effectively communicate it to an audience. This is done by
              utilising the various advantages of the different data
              visualization forms.

              Blog Post 2 - Critical Reflection - Your UI and UX
            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              User Experience (UX) is characterised by the interfaces that
              create useful interactions that serve to aid the user in
              accomplishing their goals. User Interface (UI) considers the
              visual design elements of the interfaces, and this evolves the
              usable interfaces, that are involved in UX, by making them
              readable and appealing which then leads to emotional connections.
              User interface and User Experience fundamentally focus on
              “functionality and efficiency”, however in recent times, designers
              have placed importance on the “engaging” aspect of UI and UI to
              create memorable and affective experiences (Aziz, 2023). I intend
              to analyse the UI and UX of my website “Space Gaze” while
              critically reflecting on the design elements, in an attempt to
              evaluate the efficacy of incorporating design principles.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The purpose of this website is to depict data in a meaningful
              manner while providing information about the design decisions
              made. The data that is displayed on this website comes from the
              NASA API on Asteroids, thus there is an overarching space theme
              followed throughout this website. This theme is reinforced through
              components such as the colour palette, typography as well as the
              navigational aspects; which creates “consistency” (Aziz, 2023)
              allowing for an immersive experience for the user.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The colour palette observed in Figure 1 shows a gradient between
              two colours, orange and dark blue which serve as the sun and deep
              space respectively. This gradient is placed at an angle to emulate
              the sun shining in on the website, acting as a light source for
              the content on the screen. The colour of the webpage titles in the
              nav bar is teal, which coincides with the blue themes of the
              background, this colour is also used in the background of the
              textboxes, shown in Figure 2. The repetition of the blue hues
              creates visual and emotive consistency for the user, which “weave
              emotions into design” (Aziz, 2023) this engages the user creating
              a meaningful experience. The use of these colours can also be seen
              as a Traditional Convention which helps associate this website
              with a space genre (Mailloux, 1983, p. 399).
            </p>

              The typography of the website follows the Constitutive Convention
              which helps “make sense of the text” (Mailloux, 1983, p. 404),
              this is done by creating a hierarchy of information through the
              size and density of the textual elements. This can be seen in
              Figure 2 above, where the headings of sections and the headings of
              textboxes are bold however they vary in size with the section
              headings in a larger font, while both headings are distinguishable
              from the content in the textbox (Soegaard, 2020). The Whitespace
              between the headings and textboxes also controls the visual
              hierarchy by Figure 1 Home Page of website "Space Gaze" separating
              content from each other even in the case of a single textbox where
              there is space between the heading and the rest of the text.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The Whitespace around the “rocket” button (refer to Figure 1)
              which takes the user to the bottom of the page helps the user
              differentiate it from the non-interactable object on the webpage
              such as the icon next to the “Welcome” text. The iconography used
              in this website enhances and reinforces the space theme of the
              website, which is seen by the “to the top” and “to the bottom”
              icons which are “rockets” as well as the asteroid icon in the nav
              bar.

            <p class="e-content">
              The starry background of the website is interactive since it
              responds to the movement of the mouse, the stars also immerse the
              viewer by the fading in and out creating an interesting to look at
              display. The movement of the stars as well as the fading aspect
              occur subtly, this was done to not distract or to not cause any
              irritation for the user (Sharma and Tiwari, 2021).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The starry background serves to introduce the user to the data
              visualisations that they will encounter on the website, since the
              visualisation, as depicted by Figures 3 and 4, will feature data
              on asteroids. This data is represented in scatter plots to encode
              the “relationship”(Knaflic, 2015) between the distance of the
              asteroid (y-axis) from a planet during a specific period of time
              (x-axis). For both data visualisations the points themselves will
              vary in size depending on the diameter of the asteroid that is
              depicted in the dataset, this visually conveys information quickly
              to a user. Another way that this is done is seen in Figure 3 where
              the scatter plot shows information about three planets and the
              corresponding points differ in colours “relating it to a group”
              through the observation of similarity (Knaflic, 2015).

              The plot in Figure 4 acts as an “Enclosure” (Knaflic, 2015) of the
              data pertaining to Earth from the scatter plot in Figure 3 , in
              addition to this closer view of specific values ,the user is also
              shown which asteroids are potentially hazardous. This data
              visualisation uses the “Preattentive attribute” of colour to
              “highlight” and differentiate the hazardous asteroids from the
              non-hazardous asteroids – this visually communicates information
              to the user (Knaflic, 2015). Another form of visual communication
              is the feedback given to a user when they hover their mouse over a
              data point and a textbox with information about that specific
              asteroid appears such as its magnitude and distance from the
              planet that it orbits.

              The successes of this website are identified through its coherent
              theme seen by the colour palate and the interactive elements such
              as the starry background as well as the iconography depicting
              asteroids and rockets. A failure of this website is the strict
              adherence to the textboxes shown in Figure 2, this is because all
              content on this site are indicated with the same styling which
              confines and restricts creativity by not displaying data in
              various styles.

              The website utilises elements of design such as Whitespace to
              communicate information to the user in a manner that is neatly
              laid out making it clear to read. This website follows and creates
              conventions such as the colours and iconography which construct an
              immersive experience for the user helping them navigate and
              orientate themselves throughout the site. It was also identified
              that while having consistence designs is useful it is important to
              incorporate multiple styles of design to avoid uniformity that
              could lose the attention of the user.

              Blog Post 3 - Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation

            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              A rudimentary explanation for Interaction states that it is the action taken that influences a system, however, the term “Interaction” is used in different fields and is described as being “elusive and overloaded ” (Dimara and Perin, 2020a, p. 2).Interaction is an essential aspect of Data Visualisation, Dimara and Perin organised an extensive research project which considered many explanations and mentions of Interaction used in the Visualisation community to construct a definition, the process of their research is depicted in Figure 1. I intend to discuss Interaction for Data Visualisation by examining its key features as outlined in the article What is Interaction for Data Visualisation? by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin (2020). I will then discuss the benefits of Interaction as well as the affordances of expanding the “scope of user intent” (Dimara and Perin, 2020a, p. 6) by unpacking its usage in Human-computer Interaction (HCI) while also focusing on good Interaction.

            <p class="e-content">There are external and internal entities that are requisites for Interaction for Data 
             Visualisations, these help to outline and explain the inherent features of Interaction in
              comparison to HCI (Dimara and Perin, 2020a, p. 3). The External entities are the user
              and the data with a computer acting as the mediator between the two, however, HCI 
              differs in that only a user and a computer act as the entities. External entities can go 
              beyond this by expanding the scope of the modalities used such as the inclusion of 
              different objects namely a mouse or the physical confinements of users (Dimara and 
              Perin, 2020b, p. 4). When designers expand the net of modalities, they can unlock 
              new ways of engaging a user which helps deepen the meaning of an Interaction while 
              increasing accessibility, since users are given a variety of Interaction options. The 
              Internal entity is the driving force of the Interaction, which is the intent of the user, this 
              can occur at multiple levels which range from the need to filter information to creating 
              knowledge through the exploration of the information in the data. 
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">Interaction in Data Visualisation and HCI differ in the scope of user intent, this is seen
              by HCI humanising user intent which seeks to evoke emotive reactions which is a shift 
              from the “data-driven intent” of Visualisation. Dimara and Perin suggest that by 
              adopting the humanized intent of HCI designers can create a space that enables 
              creativity which compensates for the “unanticipated goals” of a user. This encourages 
              designers to create frameworks that are flexible and fit the ever-changing needs of 
              users which makes the different actions of users “allowable”(Dimara and Perin, 2020b, 
              p. 4).
              
              
            </p> <p class="e-content">Interaction for Data Visualisations also includes External and Internal actions that are 
              necessary features for Interaction and have varying degrees of granularity that exist 
              at micro and macro levels (Dimara and Perin, 2020b, p. 4). External actions are 
              described in terms of “action-reaction pairs” (Seidelova, 2022) which define the 
              communication acts between the user and the Visualisation as a “dialogue” (Dimara 
              and Perin, 2020b, p. 6). The actions of the users evoke a response from the 
              Visualisation, these actions and responses occur through different modalities, it is 
              important to note that the responses are perceived. When one looks at the dialogue 
              of Interaction in conjunction with the perceived response, it should be noted that there 
              needs to be clarity in the response in terms of it being a reaction to the action of the 
              user, without this the response is not perceived. Dimara and Perin explain that Internal 
              actions are the cognitive process of the user which unpacks the Visualisation through 
              deductive reasoning by encoding the information, this gives meaning to Data
              Visualisations, and this aligns with the user's intent.

              </figure>
  
            </p> <p class="e-content">Figure 2 is the captured definition of Interaction for Data Visualisation that is defined 
              by Dimara and Perin which aids in the informing of design practices through the 
              understanding of Interaction (Dimara and Perin, 2020b, p. 2). This definition allows for 
              the discernment of the beneficial aspects of Interaction for Data Visualisation which 
              offers further insight than static Visualisation by helping the user enter different modes 
              of engagement (Heavy.AI, 2022). Interaction is also seen as a solution to large data 
              representations, this is because users can filter and sort through information at their 
              discretion - fulfilling their goals, as shown in Figures 3 and 4 (Seidelova, 2022).
              Another benefit of Interaction is data storytelling as users can construct knowledge
              through the manipulation of the data allowing the user to take a closer look which 
              forms new meaning from the Visualisation. The Interaction aspect of Visualisation also 
              helps draw the user's attention to specific areas in the data that allow for exploration
              (Heavy.AI, 2022) and the identification of valuable information. Despite the many 
              benefits of Interaction for Data Visualisation, there is a very evident critique, this is that
              designers focus on the mechanics of the Interaction and places less importance on 
              the depiction of the Visualisation.

            </p> <p class="e-content">
              Understanding Interaction is mandatory for designers so that they can create good 
Interactions, as a good Interaction can amplify the benefits stated above. According to 
Dimara and Perin, good Interaction allows the user to know how to use the tool and 
this does not “impose what to do with it ”(Dimara and Perin, 2020b, p. 7), this was 
seen above in designing for creativity. An example of good Interaction is when the 
dialogue occurs in a smooth manner, which means that the reaction of the Data 
Visualisation has the least amount of complexity. Another way good Interaction is 
implemented is seen by the Transmission concept which is the amount of “error-free
information per time unit” (Dimara and Perin, 2020b, p. 7), this can be accomplished 
by decreasing the number of actions needed by the user to interact with the 
Visualisation. 
            </p> <p class="e-content">Overall, Interaction is a useful feature of Data Visualisation, and it helps create 
              knowledge in new ways through engagement. The key features which included the 
              Internal and External entities as well as actions explained the components of 
              Interaction and provided a framework that the definition was constructed upon. Based 
              on the benefits of Interaction a need for designers to carefully consider and reflect
              upon their designs is stated and a need for the incorporation of Interaction is 
              expressed.

              Blog Post 4 - Critical Reflection - Data Driven Artwork
            </h3> 
            <h4>What is Data-Driven Art?</h4>
            <p class="e-content">
              Traditional data visualization involves the meaning-making of a data set and translating it
into a readable form that effectively conveys information to the viewer. Artistic
Visualizations follow suit; however it is created with the “intent” of creating art (Viégas and
Wattenberg, 2007, p. 2), thus there is an emphasis on applying aesthetics to the data. It
is necessary to make the distinction that Artistic Visualizations contain data and that the
“aesthetics” that are applied are not that of beauty but rather the idea that the artwork will
evoke the “concept of emotion” (Li, McMahon and Haddad, 2013, p. 4) (MiMi, 2023).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              I intend to analyze the Data-Driven artwork on the website Space Gaze using the
theoretical framework of Artistic Visualizations. I will also evaluate the planning and the
steps taken to create this artwork, as well as discuss the impact that my research has
had in designing the data-driven artwork through the exploration of example artworks.
            </p>
            
            <h4>What Did I hope to achieve?</h4><p class="e-content">
              The Data-Driven Artwork on the website Space Gaze displays data on asteroids from the
NASA API. The data set chosen looks at the various paths taken by each asteroid for the
duration of its life span. Only 20 asteroids are displayed as it yields over 1000 data points,
this has enough data to display overarching trends, while still being readable so that a
user is still able to see specific asteroids that are displayed in the legend.
            </p><p class="e-content">
              I wanted to create a Circular Bar plot using D3, as seen in Figure 1, I chose this because
it is seen as one of the “best ways” (Think, 2020) to display mass amounts of data due
to its aesthetic nature, by making better use of the space while allowing it to depict
“obvious patterns” in the data. Another reason that I chose a Circular Bar plot is that it is
not necessary to see the exact value of the bars since it displays the overall trends of the
asteroid, however, if a user does want to know the exact miss distance, there is a tooltip
that displays this information when a user hovers over the bars.
            </p>

                id="styleImg"
              />
              
              <figcaption>Figure 1 shows the wireframe of the data art.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4>What are examples that inspired my Data-Driven Artwork?</h4>
            <p class="e-content">
              Two examples of Data-Driven Artworks have inspired the design of the wireframe above,
both these artworks creatively convey information to the viewer, and they offer a deeper
insight into the data that is displayed. The first example directly correlates with my choice
of which bits of data to display, this example is an Orbit map of the solar system with over
1,800 data points, shown in Figure 2 (Lutz, 2019). By displaying a large amount of data,
it gives an idea of the vastness of space as well as the multitude of asteroids and comets
that are in our solar system.

            </p><p class="e-content">
              he Orbit map influenced my decision to widen the scope of data by showing the closest
approaches of all planets that an asteroid encounters. By placing all planets at the (0;0)
coordinate we can identify that an asteroid might have a smaller distance between one
planet and a larger distance between another.
            </p><p class="e-content">
              The shape of this design also fits the conventions that a user may be accustomed to
when looking at space data due to its circular nature, this has also influenced my decision
to make a Circular Bar plot. This example helped me consider what emotions and the
message I want to give the user through my data art, and it was to share this
overwhelming amount of asteroid data in a more digestible way so that the user can fully
take in the dataset. A Circular Bar plot also affects the emotions of a user as they will feel
more comfortable with the data set since it is in a familiar form. I wanted to make this
information more accessible so that people who see this design gain insight without
needing to have a scientific background, and this method of display helps accomplish
this.

            <p class="e-content">
              The second example inspired me to add the miss distance markers around the interior of
the Circular Bar plot, as this would give a sense of the distances of each planet at first
glance. It was important for me to make this data art reveal a lot of information from the
first encounter, as it deepens the understanding of the data and entices the viewer to take
a closer look and interact with the data. While the interest of the viewer is peaked by a
colourful and plentiful map, it is valuable to add interactive elements such as buttons that
filter the diagram, to give the user clearer views of the asteroid information.

            <h4>How did I go about designing it?</h4><p class="e-content">
              After designing a Circular Bar plot in d3 using the wireframe inspired by the two examples
above, I then decided to implement interactive elements, such as buttons to filter the
asteroid data for each planet. This is seen in Figure 4 where a button is generated for
every planet that the asteroids approach, when this button is clicked the other asteroids
fade and only the ones selected are visible. I decided to add this element in because I
feel easily overstimulated with large amounts of information, this filtering option clarifies
information for me. I felt that this was in line with the emotions that I wanted to create with
this data Artwork.
            </p> 
            <h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses?</h4><p class="e-content">
              A strength of this design is the distilling of information with the use of the buttons, this is
useful since it helps the user filter out which information they wish to focus on. Another
strength is the miss distance markers are aided by the tooltip, since the user can hover
over a bar and get specific values, and the user already has a sense of the value from
the markers.
            </p> <p class="e-content">
              A weakness of this design is that it only shows the data of 20 asteroids, thus future
iterations should include a slider that helps the change the set of the 20 asteroids as it is
moved. Since this data-driven artwork intends to inform the user of the trends of asteroids
the inclusion of the slider could enhance the level of understanding by comparing different
data sets.
            </p> <p class="e-content">
              This data-driven artwork is effective in its overall design, by focusing on the emotions that
it seeks to coax from a user. This design conveys a large amount of information to the
user, but it also does a good job of helping the user discover insight on their own through
the interactive elements. This design also relays the narrative that asteroids travel long
paths encountering many planets, while also displaying the shocking number of close
approaches that these asteroids have with Earth. This data-driven artwork is informative
and effective through its choice of engagement with the data set.
