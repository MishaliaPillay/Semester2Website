              Blog Post 1 - Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              Data visualisation is used to depict data in a manner that makes
              it understandable and readable (Li, 2020, p. 17). There is an
              immeasurable quantity of both large and small-scale data (Li,
              2020, p. 17) (Sadiku et al., 2016). Data is described as
              unprocessed information. There is a need for this “raw unprocessed
              information” to be translated into a visualised form (Li, 2020, p.
              18). This is because data is often consulted in decision-making to
              provide insight into certain subject matter. This in turn
              expresses concern for the narrative conveyed by the visualisation.
              Which calls for careful consideration from the designer and the
              choices made when choosing forms of data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The concept of Semiology suggests that visual depictions are signs
              that construct meaning (Kidd, 2015, p.22). Data that is
              unprocessed and not represented lacks meaning and fails to convey
              information (Li, 2020, p. 17). Thus, data is only given meaning
              and a purpose when it is represented through data visualisation.
              This takes the raw unprocessed data and communicates it,
              recognisably and understandably (Li, 2020, p. 21). This meaningful
              information can then be utilised for various purposes across
              different fields (Li, 2020, p. 17). However, the designer is
              required to compare the advantages offered by each of the forms of
              data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Different datasets require different data visualisation forms
              since each has its connotations (Kidd, 2015, p.23). Which impacts
              what is signified for the receiver (Kidd, 2015, p.24). The visual
              displays of data make use of signs that at first glance gives the
              viewer some insight as to the meaning of the information
              displayed. An example of this is the “Trees” form of data
              visualisation which consists of root nodes (Li, 2020, p. 24). This
              form arranges data by exhibiting it as a “network of nodes” (Li,
              2020, p. 24). The advantage of this is that the Tree form can
              display a larger datset. The connotation of using this data set is
              that all the nodes are connected which relay the relationships
              between them. Another connotation is that all nodes can be traced
              back to a single node thus this data set contains information that
              cannot standalone and each nodes feed into the next. There is also
              a hierarchical structure. This presence of a hierarchy implies
              that there is no equal level of importance between the individual
              nodes. Thus, some parts may be glanced over while others require a
              closer look and more attention from the viewer (Li, 2020, p. 24).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              Li, 2020 discusses the uses and some advantages of the forms of
              data visualization. Despite the many advantages of a form, it may
              not be considered a method of displaying some datasets based on
              the intended meaning of that set. This can be seen by the
              comparison of the “Table” and “Graphs” forms (Figures 1 and 2).
              Tables offer the affordance of accuracy depiction since it shows
              the precise value without an illustration (Li, 2020, p. 30).
              Graphs however offer an illustration without exact values (Li,
              2020, p. 37). The advantage of using a graph is the insight that
              it offers the reader, they can see an overall trend but cannot
              directly identify the exact differences between the data. Tables
              offer further insight since actual values are on display (Li,
              2020, p. 30). Both forms show data and relay information to the
              reader. The defining factor when choosing these two forms is what
              data is being represented and what fits the needs of the ideal
              reader.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              “The presentation of information in data form can have its own
              weight” and this statement stresses the impact that visualisation
              has on the viewer (Kidd, 2015, p.32). If there is a disconnect
              between the observed and the understood, then the visualisation
              becomes an example of misinformation (Kidd, 2015, p.23). This is
              an issue since the visualisation is intended to translate the data
              into something meaningful. There are a multitude of meanings that
              can be constructed by a visualisation (Kidd, 2015, p.26). This
              depends on the intention of the designer which for example could
              be to inform or to mislead (Li, 2020). However, a designer may
              have one intention, but the resulting visualisation is not in line
              with this. Which displays the value of being educated on data
              visualisations and representation.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              According to Representation and Myth, the signifier is layered and
              takes place at both a connotative and denotative level (Kidd,
              2015, p.23). Thus, is essential to consider the context
              surrounding the representation and its presentation. let us take a
              closer look at an example from earlier with “Graphs” and “Tables.”
              Since a table requires reading and graphs are interacted with
              visually, one needs to consider the context before deciding on the
              data visualisation form (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). If the form is used
              in a live presentation, then a Graph is favoured since the
              audience can get a quick insight into the matter discussed
              (Knaflic, 2015, p.43). However, if the Form is used in scientific
              research, then specific values are needed, and a Table shows this.
              The connotational impact is seen by the way a representation
              “frames and feeds” the understanding of a form. An example is a
              bar graph that does not start at zero on an axis which is more
              than likely to frame a situation differently by skewing one&apos;s
              perspective (Figure 3). It may zoom into slight differences making
              it seem greater than it is (Knaflic, 2015, p.43)
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The digital era has increased the rate of data collection and
              distribution. This increases the demand for Data visualisation
              (Sadiku et al., 2016). This is where we need to look at what and
              how information is being represented, as well as whose values are
              being shared through the representation. Designer is encouraged to
              educate themselves on the impact of their work and how to
              effectively communicate it to an audience. This is done by
              utilising the various advantages of the different data
              visualization forms.

              Blog Post 2 - Critical Reflection - Your UI and UX
            </h3>
            <p class="e-content">
              User Experience (UX) is characterised by the interfaces that
              create useful interactions that serve to aid the user in
              accomplishing their goals. User Interface (UI) considers the
              visual design elements of the interfaces, and this evolves the
              usable interfaces, that are involved in UX, by making them
              readable and appealing which then leads to emotional connections.
              User interface and User Experience fundamentally focus on
              “functionality and efficiency”, however in recent times, designers
              have placed importance on the “engaging” aspect of UI and UI to
              create memorable and affective experiences (Aziz, 2023). I intend
              to analyse the UI and UX of my website “Space Gaze” while
              critically reflecting on the design elements, in an attempt to
              evaluate the efficacy of incorporating design principles.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The purpose of this website is to depict data in a meaningful
              manner while providing information about the design decisions
              made. The data that is displayed on this website comes from the
              NASA API on Asteroids, thus there is an overarching space theme
              followed throughout this website. This theme is reinforced through
              components such as the colour palette, typography as well as the
              navigational aspects; which creates “consistency” (Aziz, 2023)
              allowing for an immersive experience for the user.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The colour palette observed in Figure 1 shows a gradient between
              two colours, orange and dark blue which serve as the sun and deep
              space respectively. This gradient is placed at an angle to emulate
              the sun shining in on the website, acting as a light source for
              the content on the screen. The colour of the webpage titles in the
              nav bar is teal, which coincides with the blue themes of the
              background, this colour is also used in the background of the
              textboxes, shown in Figure 2. The repetition of the blue hues
              creates visual and emotive consistency for the user, which “weave
              emotions into design” (Aziz, 2023) this engages the user creating
              a meaningful experience. The use of these colours can also be seen
              as a Traditional Convention which helps associate this website
              with a space genre (Mailloux, 1983, p. 399).

              The typography of the website follows the Constitutive Convention
              which helps “make sense of the text” (Mailloux, 1983, p. 404),
              this is done by creating a hierarchy of information through the
              size and density of the textual elements. This can be seen in
              Figure 2 above, where the headings of sections and the headings of
              textboxes are bold however they vary in size with the section
              headings in a larger font, while both headings are distinguishable
              from the content in the textbox (Soegaard, 2020). The Whitespace
              between the headings and textboxes also controls the visual
              hierarchy by Figure 1 Home Page of website "Space Gaze" separating
              content from each other even in the case of a single textbox where
              there is space between the heading and the rest of the text.
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The Whitespace around the “rocket” button (refer to Figure 1)
              which takes the user to the bottom of the page helps the user
              differentiate it from the non-interactable object on the webpage
              such as the icon next to the “Welcome” text. The iconography used
              in this website enhances and reinforces the space theme of the
              website, which is seen by the “to the top” and “to the bottom”
              icons which are “rockets” as well as the asteroid icon in the nav
              bar.

            <p class="e-content">
              The starry background of the website is interactive since it
              responds to the movement of the mouse, the stars also immerse the
              viewer by the fading in and out creating an interesting to look at
              display. The movement of the stars as well as the fading aspect
              occur subtly, this was done to not distract or to not cause any
              irritation for the user (Sharma and Tiwari, 2021).
            </p>
            <p class="e-content">
              The starry background serves to introduce the user to the data
              visualisations that they will encounter on the website, since the
              visualisation, as depicted by Figures 3 and 4, will feature data
              on asteroids. This data is represented in scatter plots to encode
              the “relationship”(Knaflic, 2015) between the distance of the
              asteroid (y-axis) from a planet during a specific period of time
              (x-axis). For both data visualisations the points themselves will
              vary in size depending on the diameter of the asteroid that is
              depicted in the dataset, this visually conveys information quickly
              to a user. Another way that this is done is seen in Figure 3 where
              the scatter plot shows information about three planets and the
              corresponding points differ in colours “relating it to a group”
              through the observation of similarity (Knaflic, 2015).
            </p>

              The plot in Figure 4 acts as an “Enclosure” (Knaflic, 2015) of the
              data pertaining to Earth from the scatter plot in Figure 3 , in
              addition to this closer view of specific values ,the user is also
              shown which asteroids are potentially hazardous. This data
              visualisation uses the “Preattentive attribute” of colour to
              “highlight” and differentiate the hazardous asteroids from the
              non-hazardous asteroids – this visually communicates information
              to the user (Knaflic, 2015). Another form of visual communication
              is the feedback given to a user when they hover their mouse over a
              data point and a textbox with information about that specific
              asteroid appears such as its magnitude and distance from the
              planet that it orbits.

              The successes of this website are identified through its coherent
              theme seen by the colour palate and the interactive elements such
              as the starry background as well as the iconography depicting
              asteroids and rockets. A failure of this website is the strict
              adherence to the textboxes shown in Figure 2, this is because all
              content on this site are indicated with the same styling which
              confines and restricts creativity by not displaying data in
              various styles.

              The website utilises elements of design such as Whitespace to
              communicate information to the user in a manner that is neatly
              laid out making it clear to read. This website follows and creates
              conventions such as the colours and iconography which construct an
              immersive experience for the user helping them navigate and
              orientate themselves throughout the site. It was also identified
              that while having consistence designs is useful it is important to
              incorporate multiple styles of design to avoid uniformity that
              could lose the attention of the user.
