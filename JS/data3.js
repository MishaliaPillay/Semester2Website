      paraOne: "There is consistent use of dashed lines to indicate the scales in this data art. This was used for the asteroid miss distance in the circular bar plot and for the scale of the magnitude of the asteroids. This has created a visual convention, the importance of this convention is that it affects the “look and feel”(Parker, 2012). This helps create flow in the design of this data art as the user can encrypt the data art quicker once they identify the scale conventions of dashed lines that are used. ",

Radar is a valuable tool in detecting and monitoring potential impact hazards. By reflecting transmitted signals off objects, images and other information can be derived from the echoes. Scientists can learn a great deal about an asteroid's orbit, rotation, size, shape, and metal concentration.",

The belt is estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. Early in the history of the solar system, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter brought an end to the formation of planetary bodies in this region and caused the small bodies to collide with one another, fragmenting them into the asteroids we observe today.",

There, the gravitational pull from the Sun and the planet are balanced by a trojan's tendency to otherwise fly out of orbit. The Jupiter trojans form the most significant population of trojan asteroids. It is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. There are Mars and Neptune trojans, and NASA announced the discovery of an Earth trojan in 2011.",
