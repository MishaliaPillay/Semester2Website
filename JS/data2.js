     </p><p class="p-summary">
       <b>Interface Elements: </b>The only user input that is required is their mouse clicks to change pages and scroll back to the top. The mouse movement also interacts with the background. In the future the data visualisation will be interactive. The moving background gives a taste of this to the user.

<figcaption><b>What is says in the image: </b> The sections with long pages and content such as the design page and the homepage have a back to the top button .The nav bar is accessible in every page so the user can easily switch between them .As a user scrolls ,the content loads and fades in . This makes for interesting response .Sections of information are separated by this fade in and these individual sections are separate paragraphs . This moulds to the amount of text present thus no use of unnecessary spacing </figcaption>

    <p class="p-summary">
    <b>Fonts: </b> I used the Segoe UI Font throughout my website. I found that this font is used on many websites, and I considered this to be a convention. This font is also legible and readable. This is vital for communicating information to the user. 

     </p><p class="p-summary">
       <b>Composition: </b>I utilised different font sizes and font weights to create a visual hierarchy. This directs the user's attention throughout the web page. The sections that contain paragraphs of text present information in a manner that is easy to read.

    <figcaption>I created this color palette in the beginning stages of this website. I decided to turn the image in a sense , to give the feel of the sun shinning in . This fits with the space aesthetic .I also used space-themed icons to add to the aesthetic as well as white text to correlate with the stars in the background. </figcaption>
