    <figcaption>This shows the List of Web Safe fonts.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In my research on the most appropriate and effective fonts, I found that some fonts are not accessible through certain devices. This is where I found Web Safe fonts, these adapt to any browser and any device. Using Web Safe fonts improves accessibility since any user is able to view the content on this website.</p>
    <p>My Sans -Serif font is a Web Safe font and it is a common font which shows its effectiveness. As discussed in the previous style guide this font is legible and it is readable which makes it easier for the user to read since they do not need to spend time figuring out the letter formation. There is also a sense of minimalism with this font causing it to be versatile and neat. </p>
   
    <p>I also made use of the Cursive font, Brush Script MT (cursive) which is Web Safe, for smaller headings in the design section of this website. The design section discusses creative decisions, and I chose this font because it mimics handwriting which adds a personal touch. This font is readable but it is not the most legible thus it is only used a few times for shorter headings. </p>

        <p>There is still a visual hierarchy of the different font-weight along with font sizes, I have however added another aspect of the visual hierarchy by changing the font of some headings in the design section. The use of this font is styled differently which draws the attention of the user directing the user's eyes through the content.</p> <p>I have also created a visual hierarchy through the light blue colour of the headings in the nav as well as the side nav bar. This creates consistency and helps the user familiarise themselves with the website.</p>
