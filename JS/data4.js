This link however only allows us to see the data for 20 asteroids at a time. I have created a slider that allows the user to choose different pages on the NASA website thus different sets of 20 asteroids are shown each time the slider is moved. ",

For my Exam data art, I wanted to explore this visual and make more use of animations. The Asteroid data is arranged by date on the y-axis and that acts as a starting point, the lines move across the screen towards the planet on the right of the screen. This simulates the asteroids moving towards planets, as the rate at which the lines move is dependent on their velocities. ",

I also found that the data is spread almost evenly and to convey this to the user I created two interactive elements in the form of buttons which show asteroids that are faster than 15 kms and asteroids that are slower than 15 kms. To stick to the convenience of my website I decided to change the opacity of the asteroids in the background when the buttons are clicked. ",
